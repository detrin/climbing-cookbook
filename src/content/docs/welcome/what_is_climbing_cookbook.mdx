This is collection of recipes, tutorials, useful links and more in one documnetation. It was created using [Astro](https://astro.build) with theme [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build). 

import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<Aside type="caution">Disclaimer: The materials on this website are for informational purposes only and do not replace a course from professional trainers.</Aside>

## Who is it for?

This should serve as cookbook for already experienced climbers that want to refresh what they have learned or they want to extend their knowledge. 
- **Who is it for?** For already experienced climbers that want to refresh on what they know or they want to extend their knowledge.
- **Who isn't it for?** People who never done rock climbing before or climbing in general. I strongly advice you to get a certified course before you start climbing or find someone who is experienced in the domain. Rock climbing is about minimizing the error while enjoying the adrenaline. Learning stuff just on your own is exposing you to the risk of learning things incorrectly and applying them outdoor where your life or life of others is at stake. 

## Motivation

It was created as collection of supplementary materials for technical part of [Sherpa Climb](https://hs.sherpaclimb.cz) course in Czech republic.
